  <h1>Withered Crops</h1>
  <h2>A Virtual Landscapez</h2>

  <p class="pink">

    This project is apart of my series of work that displays my research about Food Waste in the U.S. In this piece, I wanted to illustrate how resources are wasted in the cultivation of crops that are not harvested. A study done by CBS News discovered that about 5 tons of produce is left to waste per acre in Nothern and Central Valley California farms in 2017. There are many reasons behind the abandonment: there is no demand for products in the market, the crop does not meet the standards set by the consumer, or there are not enough funds to harvest the remaining crop.
      <br></br>
    Given that, for this project, I decided to create a  virtual "farm" with A-Frame. The viewer is put into the perspective of agricultural workers in a crop field only to watch the crops grow. The crops die at the end of the animation, recreating the scene of farmers having to watch their crops rot away on their fields. This shows to the viewers how a lot of resources are wasted during commercial farm production. The waste of produce and resources contributes to other global issues such as global warming and food insecurity. And continues to feed into the unnatural standards of "perfect produce".

    *The A-Frame website might take awhile to load due to multiple animations*
