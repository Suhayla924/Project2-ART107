  <h2>A Virtual Experience</h2>

      <p class="pink"> Being locked up in our houses during this pandemic, I have experienced that most of us have been forgetting to take care of ourselves. So for this project, I decided to create a randomizer to generate an activity that would be beneficial for your well being. Most are simple tasks you can follow through, most of them involve eating or drinking something because I believe that food is the best way to treat yourself. The little mascots are different types of fruit that I have drawn in Illustrator. They are there to prove a little relief and support to the viewer.
