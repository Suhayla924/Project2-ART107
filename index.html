  <h1>Withered Crops</h1>
  <h2>A Virtual Landscapez</h2>

  <p class="pink">
    This project is apart of my series of work that displays my research about Food Waste in the U.S.In this piece, I wanted to illustrate how resources are being wasted in growing crops that would never be picked or harvested. This project uses
    A-Frame to host a virtual environment of a farm. The viewer is put into the perspective of agricultural workers in a crop field only to watch the crops grow. The crops die at the end of the animation due to the company not wanting to pay
    farmworkers to harvest the crops or there being no demand in the market for the produce. This shows to the viewers how a lot of resources are wasted during commercial farm production. The waste of produce and resources contributes to other global
    issues such as global warming and food insecurity.
