  <hr>Ugly Produce City a Virtual Experience</hr>
      <h2></h2>

      <p><div class="text"><br>During my research I uncovered that more than ⅓ of the world’d produce is thrown away, thats over 40million tons of food thrown away in the U.S. every year. And with cities having larger populations general waste food the most.In addition, large amounts of produce is thrown away before it even reaches the hands of the consumers. In many commercial farms produce is separated by fitting a certain “standard size” in order to bring the “perfect produce” to the American population. The other produce that do not fit the ideal size and shape are often tossed away. Moreover, for my project I wanted to create a virtual city filled with “ulgy produce as the population”, embodying the information that I learned during my research and to bring awareness to the amount of food is wasted in cities. I was inspired to make a “virtual city” after looking at the work of Jacolby Satterwhite and his virtual cities populated with 3D renderings of his mother’s drawings of household objects.

        <p><div class="text"><br> The process of making the virtual city was a very difficult one since it was my first time using a virtual 3D medium like this. In the city there is an “imperfect” pineapple and a “imperfect” leek, that cover the city’s scene looping around. I had more models of fruit however, they were not rendering properly so I had to toss them out, in the future I would like a different variation of produce. There is also dumpsters and trash bins in the scene to add onto the fact that most of these “ugly produce” are tossed into landfill. I also added text to add some context to the viewer, the text reads in all caps,<i>”40 MILLION TONS OF FOOD WASTED ON A CONSUMER LEVEL MOST WASTE IS FROM LARGE CITIES ⅓ OF THE WORLD’S FOOD IS TOSSED AWAY MABY VEGETABLES THAT DO NOT FIT THE STANDARD ARE THROWN AWAY BEFORE REACHING COMMERCIAL MARKETS”.</i> I originally had used the same text to create a texture for the ground plane in the scene, however the text was not as clear as I hoped it would be.
